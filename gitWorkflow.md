Here's a Git workflow tailored for your 50 States Pixel Project to streamline development, manage collaboration, and ensure code quality.

1. Repository Structure
Organize your repository for clear separation of frontend, backend, and shared assets:
project-root/
├── frontend/            # React or other frontend framework code
├── backend/             # Node.js, Python, or other backend code
├── shared/              # Shared assets like state SVGs
├── tests/               # Automated test cases
├── .github/             # GitHub workflows (if using GitHub Actions)
├── README.md            # Project overview and instructions
├── .gitignore           # Ignore unnecessary files
└── LICENSE              # License file


2. Git Workflow
2.1. Branching Strategy
Follow the Git Feature Branch Workflow with the following branches:
main:
Contains the stable, production-ready code.
Only deployable code is merged here.
develop:
Contains the latest changes under development.
All feature branches merge here after review and testing.
Feature Branches:
Created for specific features, bug fixes, or tasks.
Use a naming convention: feature/, bugfix/, or hotfix/.
Branch Naming Conventions:
feature/add-state-routes
feature/admin-panel-ui
bugfix/route-navigation
hotfix/security-patch

2.2. Workflow Steps
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repo to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-root

Step 2: Create a Feature Branch
Always create a new branch for your work:
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

Example:
git checkout -b feature/add-state-routes

Step 3: Make Changes and Commit
Work on the feature or fix in your branch.
Stage and commit changes:
 git add .
git commit -m "Add state-specific routes and dynamic rendering"


Step 4: Push Changes to Remote
Push your feature branch to the remote repository:
git push origin feature/<feature-name>

Step 5: Open a Pull Request (PR)
Navigate to your repository on GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
Open a PR from feature/<feature-name> to develop.
Add a description, link related issues, and assign reviewers.
Step 6: Code Review
Reviewers check the code for quality, functionality, and security.
Reviewers approve the PR or request changes.
Make any requested changes and push updates:
 git push origin feature/<feature-name>


Step 7: Merge to develop
Once the PR is approved, merge it into the develop branch.
Delete the feature branch after merging:
 git branch -d feature/<feature-name>
git push origin --delete feature/<feature-name>


Step 8: Merge to main (Release)
When all changes are tested and ready for production:
Open a PR from develop to main.
Tag the release (e.g., v1.0.0):
 git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First production release"
git push origin v1.0.0



2.3. Hotfix Workflow
Create a Hotfix Branch:
 git checkout -b hotfix/<hotfix-name> main


Apply changes, test, and commit.
Merge back into main and develop:
 git checkout main
git merge hotfix/<hotfix-name>
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/<hotfix-name>



3. Best Practices
Commit Messages
Use descriptive and consistent commit messages:
Format: <type>: <short description>
Types:
feat: A new feature.
fix: A bug fix.
docs: Documentation changes.
style: Code style changes (non-functional).
refactor: Code refactoring.
test: Adding or updating tests.
chore: Maintenance tasks.
Example:
feat: Add dynamic state-specific routes
fix: Resolve admin login authentication issue


4. Automating with GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Create a .github/workflows/ci.yml file to automate testing, linting, and deployment:
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Deploy (main branch only)
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production"
          # Add deployment commands here


5. Example Workflow for a Feature
Task: Add dynamic routes for all states.
Workflow:
Create branch: feature/add-state-routes.
Make changes locally, commit, and push to remote.
Open a PR from feature/add-state-routes to develop.
Address feedback from reviewers.
Merge to develop once approved.
Merge develop into main during the next release cycle.

6. Summary
This Git workflow ensures:
Efficient collaboration with branching and PRs.
Code quality with reviews and CI/CD integration.
Scalability for adding features and fixing bugs.

Git Branching Process for the Project
To manage development efficiently, a structured branching process ensures collaborative work, code stability, and seamless feature integration. Below is a detailed guide to implementing a Git branching process for your project.

Branching Strategy
Use a combination of the Git Feature Branch Workflow and Gitflow Workflow, optimized for this project. The main branches include:
Main Branches:


main:
Contains production-ready code.
Only code that is thoroughly tested and approved is merged here.
develop:
Serves as the integration branch for features.
Code here is stable but may require additional testing before moving to main.
Supporting Branches:


Feature Branches:
Used to develop specific features or tasks.
Created from and merged back into develop.
Hotfix Branches:
For critical bug fixes in production.
Created from and merged back into both main and develop.
Release Branches:
For preparing a new production release.
Created from develop and merged back into both main and develop upon completion.

Branch Naming Conventions
Branch Type
Naming Convention
Example
Main Branch
main
main
Development Branch
develop
develop
Feature Branch
feature/<feature-name>
feature/add-pixel-grid
Hotfix Branch
hotfix/<issue-description>
hotfix/fix-upload-crash
Release Branch
release/<version>
release/v1.0.0


Branching Process
1. Setting Up the Repository
Clone the repository:
 git clone <repository-url>


Initialize the main and develop branches:
 git branch -M main
git checkout -b develop
git push origin main
git push origin develop



2. Feature Development
Create a Feature Branch:


Create a branch for a specific feature from develop:
 git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>


Example:
 git checkout -b feature/add-state-routes


Work on the Feature:


Make changes and commit frequently:
 git add .
git commit -m "feat: add dynamic state routes"


Push the Feature Branch:


Push the feature branch to the remote repository:
 git push origin feature/<feature-name>


Open a Pull Request (PR):


Merge the feature branch into develop.
Include a description, test results, and any additional details in the PR.
Code Review and Merge:


After review, merge the branch:
 git checkout develop
git merge feature/<feature-name>


Delete the Feature Branch:


Locally and remotely:
 git branch -d feature/<feature-name>
git push origin --delete feature/<feature-name>



3. Releasing Code
Create a Release Branch:


Once develop is stable, create a release branch:
 git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/<version>


Example:
 git checkout -b release/v1.0.0


Prepare for Production:


Finalize changes, fix small bugs, and update version numbers.
Commit any updates:
 git commit -m "chore: update version to v1.0.0"


Merge Release Branch:


Merge into main and tag the release:

 git checkout main
git merge release/<version>
git tag -a <version> -m "Release version <version>"
git push origin main --tags


Merge into develop to ensure continuity:

 git checkout develop
git merge release/<version>


Delete the Release Branch:

 git branch -d release/<version>
git push origin --delete release/<version>



4. Hotfixes
Create a Hotfix Branch:


Create from main:
 git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/<issue-description>


Example:
 git checkout -b hotfix/fix-upload-crash


Fix the Issue:


Make the necessary changes and commit:
 git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve upload crash issue"


Merge Hotfix Branch:


Merge into both main and develop:
 git checkout main
git merge hotfix/<issue-description>
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/<issue-description>


Tag and Push:


Tag the hotfix if necessary:
 git tag -a <hotfix-version> -m "Hotfix <hotfix-version>"
git push origin main --tags


Delete the Hotfix Branch:

 git branch -d hotfix/<issue-description>
git push origin --delete hotfix/<issue-description>



5. Integration and CI/CD
Continuous Integration:
Use GitHub Actions or similar tools to run automated tests for every pull request or merge.
Deployment:
Automatically deploy the main branch to production and the develop branch to a staging environment.

6. Best Practices
Commit Often:


Use small, atomic commits with meaningful messages.
Example: feat: add state route validation.
Code Reviews:


Always review PRs before merging.
Avoid Merging into Main Directly:


Ensure all changes go through develop or feature branches.
Keep Branches Short-Lived:


Avoid long-running branches to minimize merge conflicts.
Document Merges:


Use PR descriptions to document the purpose and details of merges.
