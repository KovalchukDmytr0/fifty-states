Regression testing ensures that new changes in your application (e.g., features, bug fixes) don't break existing functionality. Below is a comprehensive regression testing strategy for the 50 States Pixel Project.

1. Plan Regression Test Scenarios
Identify key features that need to be tested to ensure nothing is broken.
Core Features to Test
User Features:
Navigation to all 50 state pages.
Submitting a new pixel order with valid and invalid data.
Viewing a state's page with all approved images.
Admin Features:
Admin login and access to the admin panel.
Viewing, approving, and declining orders.
Rendering approved images on state pages.
Security:
Authentication for admin-only routes.
Protection against SQL injection, XSS, and unauthorized access.
Database Integrity:
Orders stored correctly in the database.
Approved images linked to the correct state page.
Performance:
No degradation in response time for API endpoints.
Correct rendering of high-resolution images on state pages.

2. Test Cases
User Navigation
Test Case
Expected Result
Navigate to each state page via the map
The correct state page is displayed with a 1000x1000 pixel grid and any approved images.
Navigate using direct URL (/state/:stateName)
The correct state page is displayed, or a 404 error if the state name is invalid.
Return to the main page
Navigation back to the main page works without errors.


Order Submission
Test Case
Expected Result
Submit a valid order
Order is saved in the database with status = 'pending'.
Submit an order with invalid email
An error message is returned (Invalid email address).
Submit an order with unsupported image format
An error message is returned (Unsupported file format).
Submit an order with out-of-bound pixel size
An error message is returned (Pixel size exceeds canvas dimensions).
Submit an order with missing data
An error message is returned (All fields are required).


Admin Panel
Test Case
Expected Result
Admin login with valid credentials
Admin is authenticated, and a token is returned.
Admin login with invalid credentials
An error message is returned (Invalid username or password).
Access admin routes without a token
An error message is returned (Access denied).
Approve an order
The order's status is updated to approved, and the image appears on the correct state page.
Decline an order
The order is removed from the database and does not appear on the state page.
Fetch all pending orders
A list of pending orders is returned, including all relevant data (state, email, pixel size, image, etc.).


Image Rendering
Test Case
Expected Result
Approved images render on state pages
Approved images are displayed at their correct coordinates on the state page canvas.
Images overlap properly if required
Overlapping images do not disrupt other images or the canvas layout.
Large images do not cause performance issues
Images are optimized, and state pages load without noticeable delay.


Security
Test Case
Expected Result
Access admin panel without login
Access is denied (401 Unauthorized).
Attempt SQL injection in form fields
Input is sanitized, and no database commands are executed.
Submit a script tag in a text field (XSS test)
The input is escaped, and no scripts are executed in the browser.


3. Testing Tools
Use the following tools for automating and executing regression tests:
Frontend Testing:


Cypress:
Automate navigation, form submissions, and rendering checks.
Example test:
 describe('State Page Navigation', () => {
  it('should load the California page correctly', () => {
    cy.visit('/state/california');
    cy.get('h1').contains('CALIFORNIA Pixel Page');
    cy.get('#pixelGrid').should('exist');
  });
});


Backend Testing:


Jest or Mocha:
Test API endpoints, database queries, and business logic.
Example test:
 test('Fetch pending orders', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/api/admin/orders');
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
  expect(response.body).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
});


Load Testing:


Apache JMeter or k6:
Simulate high traffic and ensure the site performs well under load.
Example:
Test /api/state/:stateName/images with 1000+ concurrent requests.
Security Testing:


OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite:
Scan for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

4. Execute Regression Tests
Run all tests after:
Implementing new features.
Fixing bugs.
Deploying updates to the site.
Document any failed tests and prioritize fixing them.

5. Recommendations
Automate Regression Testing:


Set up Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) to automatically run tests on every code push.
Test Coverage Reports:


Use tools like Istanbul or Codecov to ensure sufficient coverage across all functionalities.
Database Snapshots:


Use test databases with consistent snapshots for reproducible tests.

Conclusion
This regression testing plan provides comprehensive coverage for your site's core functionality, ensuring stability and reliability. Let me know if you’d like help setting up automated testing or running specific tests!
