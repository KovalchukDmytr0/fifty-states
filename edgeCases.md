Identifying edge cases is critical to ensure your project handles unexpected scenarios effectively. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive breakdown of possible edge cases in the 50 States Pixel Project, categorized by functionality.

1. User Navigation Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
User enters an invalid state URL
Show a 404 error page.
Validate the state name and ensure the frontend and backend return a consistent 404 response.
User rapidly switches between state pages
Pages should load without crashing or slowing down.
Implement debounce/throttle mechanisms for navigation actions.
User accesses a state directly by URL
The state page should load correctly or show 404.
Validate all routes dynamically and return 404 for invalid states.


2. Order Submission Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
User submits an order without an email
Return a validation error.
Check for email field completeness and validate format.
User submits unsupported image formats
Return a clear error message (e.g., "Unsupported format").
Validate file type (e.g., MIME type) before processing uploads.
User submits a very large image
Return an error indicating the size limit exceeded.
Restrict file size (e.g., 5 MB) and provide feedback before the form is submitted.
User selects invalid pixel dimensions
Return an error indicating the issue.
Validate that pixel dimensions fit within the canvas (1000x1000).
User submits overlapping pixel areas
Prevent duplicate or overlapping placements.
Check against existing pixel placements before approving orders.
Simultaneous submissions for the same area
Handle concurrency gracefully without conflicts.
Use transactions or locks in the database when reserving pixel areas.


3. State Page Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
All pixels on the state page are occupied
Clearly indicate that no pixels are available.
Display "Sold Out" messages and disable the purchase option for that state.
State page contains hundreds of images
The page should load quickly and not crash.
Use lazy loading and optimize image rendering with smaller thumbnails.
User zooms or resizes the browser window
The grid should resize without distortion.
Implement responsive grid scaling and maintain aspect ratios.
User submits an invalid pixel position
Show an error or adjust to the nearest valid position.
Validate coordinates against the canvas boundaries before saving.


4. Admin Panel Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
Admin approves an order that overlaps another
Prevent overlapping images.
Check for collisions before approving orders.
Admin declines an order in progress
Ensure order is removed without disrupting others.
Use atomic database operations to ensure clean deletions.
Admin logs in with incorrect credentials
Return a clear error message (e.g., "Invalid password").
Implement rate-limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
Multiple admins edit the same state page
Changes should not conflict.
Use locking or real-time syncing for collaborative admin actions.


5. Security Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
User attempts SQL injection in form fields
Queries should not be executed.
Use prepared statements for all database interactions.
User uploads malicious scripts in images
Prevent scripts from being executed.
Sanitize and validate uploaded files to ensure they are images only.
Unauthorized access to admin routes
Access should be denied.
Implement authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in form inputs
Scripts should not execute in the browser.
Escape and sanitize all user inputs before rendering them on the frontend.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
Requests should fail without valid tokens.
Use CSRF tokens to validate legitimate requests.


6. Image Rendering Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
Very large images slow down rendering
The page should load efficiently.
Compress images during upload and store optimized versions.
Overlapping images are not displayed correctly
Maintain proper layering and visibility.
Render images in the order of approval or based on z-index logic.
Image file is corrupted or missing
Show a placeholder or error message.
Validate file integrity during upload and handle missing files gracefully.


7. Performance Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
Thousands of users access the site concurrently
The site should remain responsive.
Use caching (e.g., Redis), CDNs, and load balancers for scaling.
Database queries slow down with many records
Queries should execute efficiently.
Index database columns (e.g., state_id, x_position, y_position) and optimize query logic.
Real-time changes are not reflected
Pages should update dynamically without reload.
Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates.


8. Accessibility Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
Screen readers cannot interpret the grid
Provide meaningful descriptions for images and grid areas.
Use alt text for images and ARIA labels for grid elements.
Keyboard navigation skips interactive elements
All interactive elements should be keyboard-accessible.
Ensure proper tab order and focus states for all interactive elements.


9. Deployment Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
Deployment fails mid-process
Site should remain in its previous stable state.
Use atomic deployments with tools like Docker or Kubernetes.
Database schema changes break functionality
Changes should not disrupt live data.
Use migrations to apply schema changes incrementally.
New feature rollout causes bugs
Bugs should not affect all users.
Use feature flags to gradually enable new features.


10. Localization Edge Cases
Scenario
Expected Behavior
Handling
User from a non-English locale accesses the site
Content should display correctly.
Provide translations for all text elements and fallback to English when translations are unavailable.


Next Steps
Testing:
Create test cases for each edge case.
Use both manual and automated testing to validate behavior.
Monitoring:
Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry) to detect unexpected issues.
Optimization:
Address performance bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities.
Let me know if you'd like help implementing specific edge case tests or setting up tools to monitor and address these cases!
